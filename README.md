# Hi there, I'm Krzysztof üëã

I'm a computer science student at SGGW in Warsaw, Poland, and I also work as a frontend developer at T-Mobile Polska S.A. I am passionate about building modern and scalable full-stack applications with cutting-edge technologies like Rust, Python, JavaScript frameworks, TypeScript, and GraphQL.

## üî≠ Currently working on
- Simple web app that analyzes uploaded by the user Minecraft mod jar file

## üå± I'm currently learning
- Mastering building frontend apps with React, Next.js 13, MUI, OpenAPI, and Zod

## üèÜ Achievements
- Awarded the rector's scholarship for academic excellence in my first year of study.
- Ranked as the top student in the first year of Computer Science at SGGW in Warsaw.

## üé¨ Finished Bigger Projects
- An Android game as part of the Software Engineering subject at SGGW-WULS in cooperation with other students. As a group leader, I was designing an architecture of the app, making tasks (issues), controlling, monitoring the progress of work, motivating students to get their job done, and reviewing code written by them. I've learned a bunch of stuff about websockets servers and clients.

Thanks for visiting my profile! Feel free to reach out to me anytime to discuss exciting opportunities or just to say hello!
